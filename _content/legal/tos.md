## Litany Accounts and Usage.

**Description.** Your Litany account will allow you to access and subscribe to the Litany suite of products.

**Your Litany Account and Published Content.** If you publish content on Litany, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and published content, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the published content. You must immediately notify Litany of any unauthorized uses of your published content, your account, or any other breaches of security. Litany will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.

**Responsibility of Contributors.** If you publish content, comment on published content, post material to Litany, post links on Litany, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available (any such material, "Content"), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct. That is the case regardless of what form the Content takes, which includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio, or code. By using Litany, you represent and warrant that your Content and conduct do not violate these terms or the User Guidelines. By submitting Content to Litany for inclusion on your website, you grant Litany a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing, and promoting your published content. If you delete Content, Litany will use reasonable efforts to remove it from Litany, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, Litany has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Litany's sole discretion, (i) reclaim your username or website's URL due to prolonged inactivity, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in Litany's reasonable opinion, violates any Litany policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (iii) terminate or deny access to and use of Litany to any individual or entity for any reason.  Litany will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid. 

**Web Traffic.** We use a tool called "[Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/)" to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our website. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to your browser on the date of your visit, instead of your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with any personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a "cookie" on your web browser to identify you as a unique user, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing your return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser. Please refer to your browser settings for additional information on disabling cookies.

Upgrades can be canceled at any time in the Upgrades section of your website's dashboard.

## Responsibility of Visitors.

Litany has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, posted to our Services, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material's content, use or effects.

You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. Our Services may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. Our Services may also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or infringes the intellectual property and other proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which is subject to additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated.

Litany does not have any control over those non-Litany websites, and is not responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to a non-Litany website, Litany does not represent or imply that it endorses such website. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. Litany disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from your use of non-Litany websites and webpages.

## Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy.

As Litany asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material located on or linked to by Litany violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify Litany in accordance with Litany's [Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") Policy](/legal/dmca.html). Litany will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. Litany will terminate a visitor's access to and use of the Website if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of Litany or others. In the case of such termination, Litany will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to Litany.
