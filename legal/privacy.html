<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>The following terms and conditions govern all use of the Litany website and all content, services, and products available at or through the website, including, but not limited to NovelNode and all future services, (taken together, our Services). Our Services are offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, <a href="/legal/tos.html">Litany's Terms of Service</a>) and procedures that may be published from time to time by Litany (collectively, the "Agreement"). You agree that we may automatically upgrade our Services, and these terms will apply to any upgrades. Your agreement is with Litany Inc. ("Litany" or "we").</p>
<p>Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our services, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access or use any of our services. If these terms and conditions are considered an offer by Litany, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms.</p>
<p>Our Services are not directed to children younger than 13, and access and use of our Services is only offered to users 13 years of age or older. If you are under 13 years old, please do not register to use our Services. Any person who registers as a user or provides their personal information to our Services represents that they are 13 years of age or older.</p>
<p>Use of our Services may require a Litany account. You agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for an account. You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your username. You are responsible for keeping your password secure.</p>
<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
<p>Like most website operators, Litany collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Litany's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Litany's visitors use its website. From time to time, Litany may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Litany also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users posting material to Litany services. Litany only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
<h3>Third-party Trackers</h3>
<p>We use third-party tracking code, such as a tool called "<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>" to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our website. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to your browser on the date of your visit, instead of your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with any personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a "cookie" on your web browser to identify you as a unique user, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">Google Analytics Terms of Use</a> and the <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>This website also uses Facebook's Conversion Tracking Pixel service, which allows us to market content to users who have visited our site.  Please refer to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">Facebook's Privacy Policy</a> for more information.</p>
<p>You can prevent third-party tracking code from recognizing your return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser or installing ad-blockers or privacy guards. Please refer to your browser settings for additional information on disabling cookies.  Consider installing <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">Privacy Badger</a>, a free browser extension provided by the <a href="https://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Please not that Litany and its suppliers and licensors hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement in regards to third-party privacy solutions.</p>
<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Certain visitors to Litany's websites choose to interact with Litany in ways that require Litany to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Litany gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at NovelNode.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Litany are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Litany collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Litany. Litany does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
<p>Litany may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Litany may monitor the most popular pages on the NovelNode.com site.  Litany may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Litany does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Litany discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Litany's behalf or to provide services available at Litany's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Litany's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Litany will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Litany discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Litany believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Litany, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Litany website and have supplied your email address, Litany may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Litany and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Litany takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Litany uses cookies to help Litany identify and track visitors, their usage of Litany website, and their website access preferences. Litany visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Litany's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Litany's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h2>Business Transfers</h2>
<p>If Litany, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Litany goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Litany may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<h2>Ads</h2>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Litany and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>Comments and other content submitted to our Akismet anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives or missed spam, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives and missed spam.</p>
<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Litany may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Litany's sole discretion. Litany encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. We are constantly updating our Services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by posting the updated policy documents to our website. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms that were in place when the dispute arose, (including the addition, modification or removal of a binding individual arbitration clause).</p>
